      "LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew more strongly than expected in early 2025, giving a boost to the government and finance minister Rachel Reeves, who nevertheless faces a stiffer test ahead due to her tax hike on businesses and Donald Trump's trade wars. `Between January and March, the economy accelerated to show growth of 0.7%, up sharply from an increase of 0.1% in the last three months of 2024, official data showed on Thursday. `That was above the 0.6% growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and which was also expected by the Bank of England. `In March alone, the economy grew unexpectedly, expanding by 0.2% from February, the Office for National Statistics said. The Reuters poll had pointed to a flat reading of 0.0%. `Sterling edged up against the U.S. dollar after the data was announced. `Reeves, who has been under fire from business leaders and opposition parties for her decision to increase social security contributions from April, said the data was a show of strength in the economy and its potential. `\"In the first three months of the year, the UK economy has grown faster than the U.S., Canada, France, Italy and Germany,\" she said in a statement. `Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are trying to kick-start the economy via increased spending on infrastructure and other reforms that they hope will boost investment. `However, the BoE said last week it expected the strong growth in the January-to-March period would prove temporary with output likely to expand by 1% this year, speeding up only slightly to 1.5% growth in 2027. `Trump's trade tariffs are expected to slow the global economy while British businesses have said they will be hit by big rises in employment taxes ordered by Reeves and in the minimum wage, which both came into effect in April. `Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, an accountancy body, said the first-quarter growth spurt was likely to prove temporary with some businesses rushing to meet orders before the U.S. tariffs took effect. `\"This robust quarterly reading is probably the pinnacle for economic growth this year, with activity  likely to slow sharply going forward as tax and tariff rises and global uncertainty bite,\" Thiru said. `But last week's new trade deal signed with the United States could limit the blow to Britain's economy. Under the deal the U.S. will reduce higher tariffs on steel and aluminium but will continue to impose a new 10% tariff on imports of most British goods. `So far, Britain's consumers have remained largely unfazed by worries about the outlook for the economy. Data published this week showed a rise in their spending over March and April. `The ONS said growth in the first three months of 2025 was largely driven by the services sector although production grew significantly too after a period of decline. `Business investment grew strongly, expanding by 5.9% from the last quarter of 2024, the biggest increase in two years. `Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior U.K. economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said some of the jump in business investment reflected a big increase in imports of aircraft, which count as investment. `Real GDP per head - which gives a better sense of how economic growth is being felt by people - grew by 0.5%, following two consecutive quarterly falls, the ONS said.",

      'RIYADH/DOHA, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was wrapping up his Gulf tour on Friday having secured what the White House says is over $2 trillion for the U.S. economy in combined deals. `How that number was calculated is unclear. Based on a Reuters tally of all the specific deals announced, the total value is over $700 billion. But deal inflation is not unusual on any major visit, let alone one by a U.S. president who has long prided himself as an expert dealmaker. `The trip included big orders of Boeing planes, deals to buy U.S. defence equipment, data and technology agreements and other contracts. `But financial experts and diplomats say the headline figures have been padded out in both sides\' desire to showcase the extent of their cooperation. `Of the corporate agreements worth up to $549 billion during the Trump\'s Gulf tour, many were non-binding memorandums of understanding, according to a Reuters analysis. `The defence sales agreed with Saudi Arabia and Qatar took the overall tally close to $730 billion, by Reuters\' calculations. `Reuters could not independently verify whether additional agreements were signed without public disclosure. `"The amounts are inflated, possible spending is counted as actual - and most of the solid deals ... would have happened irrespective of who was in the White House," said Justin Alexander, Director of Khalij Economics. `During his first term, Trump said Saudi Arabia had agreed to $450 billion in deals with the U.S., but actual trade and investment flows amounted to less than $300 billion between 2017 to 2020, according to data compiled by the Arab Gulf States Institute. `"DEALMAKER IN CHIEF" `In response to a question about the figures, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told Reuters: “President Trump is the Dealmaker in Chief, and these trillions of dollars in economic agreements are great news for American companies and workers. The President is quickly delivering on his promises to Make America Strong and Wealthy Again." `A Qatari official reached by Reuters did not provide comprehensive details about Doha\'s commitment to Washington, and Saudi and UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for details. `Memorandums of understanding are less formal than contracts and do not always turn into cash transactions. `Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), opens new tab, for example, announced it had signed 34 deals with U.S. companies worth up to $90 billion on AI infrastructure and other areas. But most of the tie-ups were non-binding MoUs without a value attached. `Aramco\'s agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year for a 20-year term from NextDecade had already been announced months earlier, but was still included in Wednesday\'s tally. `The White House said agreements signed with Qatar\'s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani would "generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion", and included a $96 billion sale to Qatar Airways. But it did not offer a comprehensive breakdown `A Qatari official said Qatar\'s sovereign wealth fund had made an "economic pledge" to invest $500 billion in the U.S. economy over the next 10 years, but that this did not yet include anything concrete. `"If the past is precedent, promised deals that have no real return on investment will eventually be shelved after having served their political purpose," said Firas Maksad, managing director at consulting firm Eurasia Group. `On the defence side, Washington signed a $142 billion arms package with Saudi Arabia covering purchases from more than a dozen U.S. companies, and what Trump said was a $42 billion defence deal with Qatar. `During his first term, Trump celebrated an announcement of approximately $110 billion of arms sales during his visit to Saudi Arabia. `But such deals extend over many years and are hard to track closely. As of 2018, only $14.5 billion of sales had been initiated and Congress began to question the deals in light of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. `BEYOND THE NUMBERS `Despite the vagueness of the commitments and timelines, the news has boosted some market stocks. `Deutsche Bank attributed a 4.16% rise in Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab on Wednesday to the MoU announced by Saudi state oil giant Aramco. `And there were concrete new deals for U.S. companies. `Qatar Airways\' order for 160 Boeing jetliners with GE Aerospace engines is worth $96 billion. And Abu Dhabi\'s Etihad Airways will spend $14.5 billion to buy 28 Boeing aircraft with GE engines. `Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab shares closed up 0.64% on Wednesday after the Doha reveal. `But some of the real gains of Trump\'s tour lie beyond the raw numbers. `Most importantly, the three Gulf countries have secured U.S. support for files they see as key. `Saudi Arabia is moving closer to its long-held aspiration to develop a civil nuclear energy industry, which Trump has delinked from normalising relations with Israel, a major win for the kingdom. `The UAE has signed a framework that puts it on a pathway to acquiring the advanced semiconductors it wants in order to fulfil its long-held ambition of AI leadership. `And Qatar received Trump\'s assurance that the U.S. would protect it if it ever came under attack. `"I think there is a wider symbolic dividend here," said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. `"While many of the U.S.\'s traditional partners and allies have had a particularly tense few months of relations with the U.S., trying to navigate Trump\'s economic policies and his controversial approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, here are the Gulf States concluding unprecedented business deals and arms sales and taking their bilateral relationship to the next level."',

      "The UK economy grew at the fastest pace in a year between January and March, defying warnings of a collapse in activity, as businesses scrambled to invest and export before Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. `The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the quarter, beating City predictions of a 0.6% rise and continuing an expansion after growth of 0.1% in the final three months of last year. `Driven by Britain’s dominant services sector, the latest snapshot will bolster the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after business leaders had warned earlier this year that her tax policies would hit jobs and growth. `However, economists cautioned that growth later in the year was likely to be much weaker, amid concerns over the fallout from Trump’s erratic tariff plans after his “liberation day” announcement on 2 April. `The ONS said growth in the service sector economy was broad-based over the first quarter, with retail, wholesale and computer programming having a strong start to the year, as did car leasing and advertising. This was slightly offset by falls in education, telecoms and legal services. `Alongside growth of 0.7% in the service sector, production – which includes manufacturing, mining and energy – rose by 1.1%, while activity in the construction sector showed no growth. `The latest snapshot is in sharp contrast to the alarm being sounded by business leaders earlier this year, who warned that Reeves’s autumn budget – including a £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions from April – risked crashing the economy into recession. `However, economists said much of the strength in the first quarter was the result of stronger levels of business investment as companies rushed to beat the US president’s tariffs, with higher spending on aircraft, IT equipment and machinery. `“That rise is completely at odds with the plunge in business confidence triggered by the large rises in national insurance contributions for employers and the minimum wage announced in October’s budget and the US tariff concerns this year,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. `Highlighting the scramble to beat Washington’s swingeing border taxes, UK export volumes increased by 3.5%, after three consecutive quarterly declines, leading international trade to add 0.4 percentage points to GDP growth in the first quarter. `“It is clear some frontrunning of trade was in play,” said Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. `Reeves said the figures showed the government’s plan was working as the British economy had outpaced all of its G7 peers in the first quarter. `“Up against a backdrop of global uncertainty we are making the right choices now in the national interest. Since the election we have already had four interest rate cuts, signed two trade deals, saved British Steel and given a pay rise to millions by increasing the minimum wage,” she said. `Keir Starmer’s government has sought to insulate Britain from the international fallout by striking trade deals and focusing attention on the government’s industrial strategy, including agreeing an accord with Washington to reduce some of Trump’s tariffs on cars, aluminium and steel. `The UK prime minister also agreed a long-desired trade deal with India, and will next week push for closer trade ties with the EU at a summit designed to “reset” relations with Brussels after Brexit. `Analysts had anticipated bumper growth in the first quarter, after an unexpectedly strong 0.5% expansion in February. In the end the figure came in even higher than forecast as monthly data showed that GDP rose by 0.2% in March. That surpassed City economists’ predictions of zero growth for the month. `Despite surveys of consumer confidence and business sentiment having shown a sharp decline in recent months, British households have so far proven resilient to the heightened economic uncertainty. `That could change over the coming months, as growth is expected to be far weaker as Trump’s tariff policies torpedo business confidence and weigh heavily on international trade. `The Bank of Englandsaid last week Britain’s prospects had worsened amid the heightened global uncertainty over the US president’s trade wars, as it forecast near stagnant activity for the rest of the year. `Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said the government’s tax increases would put progress in the economy at risk. “While it’s welcome the economy is growing, both the OBR and IMF have downgraded the UK’s growth.” `",

      "LONDON -- The British economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025, official figures showed Thursday, in a welcome boost to the Labour government, which has made lifting the country's growth its top priority. `The Office for National Statistics said growth, as measured by gross domestic product, increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year from the final three months of 2024, with the country's dominant services sector doing particularly well. `The first quarter increase makes the British economy the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. `Growth was modestly ahead of market expectations for a 0.6% increase. It was also the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2024, when the economy expanded by 0.9%. `Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the growth leap, and said the figures showed the choices made by Labour since it was elected last July were beginning to pay off. `“We’re set to be the fastest growing economy in the G-7 in the first three months of this year and that’s incredibly welcome, but I know that there is more to do,\" she said while on a visit to a Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, northern England. `Most economists think is likely to slow down in the second quarter of the year, partly because of the global uncertainty generated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. `Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the U.S.-China trade war persists. `Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Though Trump kept the 10% baseline tariffs on U.K., he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum. `Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the growth uptick will likely be short-lived, especially during the second quarter when trade uncertainty will be at its peak. `“Exporters will likely see reduced demand as well from higher U.S. tariffs and weaker global demand,” he said. `Economists said growth will likely falter in the second quarter as new taxes on business were imposed in April. Also a raft of price rises during the month, including domestic energy and water bills, are expected to keep a lid on consumer demand.",

      "The UK economy grew in the first three months of 2025 by more than expected, and at the fastest rate in a year. `Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.7% between January and March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, ahead of the 0.6% some economists had been forecasting. `While economists and the Government have welcomed the data showing the economy was strengthening at the beginning of the year, experts have pointed out that the picture has changed significantly since then, with Donald Trump unleashing new US tariffs in April. `Here, the PA news agency looks at why GDP has increased and what’s next for the UK economy. `– What is gross domestic product? `Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the term typically used to describe the size of a nation’s economy. `It is the measure of what is going on financially across all companies, governments and households. `– What drove growth at the beginning of 2025? `The UK’s services sector was the biggest driver of growth, which picked up by 0.7% over the quarter. `The wide-reaching industry is a dominant part of the UK economy, spanning businesses including hospitality, entertainment and culture, finance and insurance, and real estate and business services. `The ONS said growth in services was “broad based, with wholesale, retail and computer programming all having a strong quarter as did car leasing and advertising”. `Production also “grew significantly” over the quarter, up 1.1%, following a period of decline. This incorporates sectors including manufacturing, mining, and electricity supply. `– Do the GDP figures mean the economy is healthy? `Experts have said it is positive that the economy was in good shape at the beginning of the year, and marks a rebound after being more or less flat throughout the second half of 2024. `Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the GDP figures “show the strength and potential of the UK economy”. `“Up against a backdrop of global uncertainty we are making the right choices now in the national interest,” she said. `However, the latest data covers the period before some significant changes to UK and global economic conditions from April – namely tax rises, and Donald Trump introducing new tariffs on US imports. `– What effect will tax rises have? `The higher rate of employer national insurance, coupled with increases to the national living wage, have driven up labour costs for many businesses since April. `Experts said this could lead to businesses pulling back spending or cutting staff, or passing on higher costs through price rises. `Nevertheless, economists pointed out that the latest ONS figures showed a burst of business investment over the first quarter – which jumped by 5.9%, following a 1.9% decline at the end of 2024. `This suggests that firms may not have been as worried about the April cost rises as previously thought and indicates economic momentum heading into a more uncertain period. `– What about tariffs? `James Smith, an economist for ING, suggested there was evidence of “front-loading” over the first quarter – meaning businesses were ramping up exports in anticipation of trade demand falling sharply. `“Manufacturing was up by 0.8% in the first three months of the year, and we know that transport equipment – the major export to the US – drove the bulk of that growth,” he said. `It suggests that businesses were trying to get ahead before US President Donald Trump introduced a 10% levy on almost all goods entering the US. `Since the president’s “liberation day” tariff announcements in April, things have become more uncertain for businesses that trade with the world’s biggest economy. `The UK has since agreed a trade agreement with the US which will relieve pressure on certain sectors, but experts think the wider uncertainty has been dragging on businesses and households’ willingness to spend money. `– Will the economy keep growing? `The Bank of England predicted last week that the UK economy will grow by 1% this year, upgrading its previous 0.75% forecast on the back of a strong start to 2025. `However, it cut its growth forecast to 1.25% for 2026, from 1.5% in its February projections, as a result of the impact of tariffs. `Economists think economic growth will slow in the coming quarters, but that lower interest rates and higher wages could provide a tonic for consumers. `Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist for Deutsche Bank, said: “The jump in GDP will likely be short-lived, however. `“Trade uncertainty will likely hit its peak in the second quarter of 2025. Exporters will likely see reduced demand as well from higher US tariffs and weaker global demand.” `Elliott Jordan-Doak, a senior UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that a “broader slowdown in global growth” could be offset by “fading consumer caution and real wage increases” boosting UK workers.",

There's evidence businesses may have increased Q1 exports in anticipation of these tariffs. Consequently, while the Bank of England raised its 2025 growth forecast to 1%, it lowered its 2026 projection, with experts anticipating a slowdown tempered by potential boosts to consumer spending from lower interest rates and higher wages.",

      "On his tour of the Middle East this week, Donald Trump announced a slew of multibillion-dollar tech deals with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. With the sale of the US’s most advanced technology, he also sold the American model of the industry that made it: enormous amounts of power concentrated in the hands of a few men. `The announcements poured in last week: the US and the United Arab Emirates agreed on Abu Dhabi as the site of the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the US. The deal reportedly allows the UAE to import half a million Nvidia semiconductor chips, considered the most advanced in the world for the creation of artificial intelligence products. Saudi Arabia struck a similar deal for semiconductors, obtaining the promise of the sale of hundreds of thousands of Nvidia Blackwell chips to Humain, an AI startup owned by its sovereign wealth fund. Cisco said it had signed a deal with a UAE AI firm to develop the country’s AI sector. The agreements also directed some investment by Saudi firms into US technology and manufacturing. Amazon Web Services and Qualcomm likewise announced deals on cloud computing and cybersecurity. `The agreements were remarkable for several reasons. Styling himself the broker-in-chief, Trump brought along an entourage of dozens of CEOs to the Middle East, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, Palantir’s Alex Karp and two dozen others. `Those executives negotiated their deals face-to-face with Gulf country leaders. Many of those agreements broke with the policies of Joe Biden’s administration, which imposed strict controls on the sales of the US’s most cutting-edge technology. Biden forbade Nvidia and other chipmakers from selling their latest wares to Middle Eastern powers because of the latter’s links to China. Whether the Gulf states keep the tech for themselves as stipulated – the enormous datacenter is to be built by an Emirati company but managed by American ones – or proffer it to China in a geopolitical backroom deal remains to be seen. `Despite the uncertainty that arose from some corners, the Trump White House put out three press releases that trumpeted how the president had “secured historic investment commitments” that total in the trillions from the three oil-rich nations. A section of one fact sheet was headlined: “Never tired of winning.” `The deals stand to enrich the tech CEOs substantially by opening up new audiences for their products. These are the same men at the helm of AI development, and Trump’s use of them as surrogates seems likely to propagate the American model of technological power in new places. `Also notable throughout the trip: Elon Musk demonstrated he still wields considerable influence in the White House. The world’s richest person may have pivoted from the government cost-cutting project of Doge, but there he was, beside the president once again. `Musk’s presence on the trip had less to do with AI than Altman’s or Huang’s, though. His value to the president’s dealmaking was his power over global internet connectivity. Starlink, the satellite internet division within Musk’s SpaceX that controls more than half the satellites orbiting Earth, inked an agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia. There he goes again: his Tesla Optimus robots performed a dance for Trump and the Saudi crown prince to the tune of YMCA.",

      "During his Middle East tour, Donald Trump, accompanied by numerous tech CEOs, facilitated multibillion-dollar deals with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar involving advanced technology like AI semiconductors from Nvidia, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. These agreements, highlighted by White House press releases, mark a departure from the Biden administration's stricter tech export policies concerning the Middle East and China. The deals are expected to significantly benefit the involved tech executives and promote the American model of concentrated technological influence, with Elon Musk also securing a Starlink deal.",

      "Trump capped a Middle East trip marked by both business pledges and sensitive diplomacy in Abu Dhabi today. The United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) agreed on $200 billion in deals, the White House said. They made plans for U.S. technology to supply an Emirati artificial intelligence (AI) campus. Trump also issued updates during the trip on diplomatic hotspots and urged Russian and Ukrainian officials to attend talks in Istanbul, Turkey that began today after a delay. `Middle East chip access. U.S. tech CEOs voiced enthusiasm about growing business in Gulf countries, but the prospect spurred debate among current and former U.S. officials worried it could compromise national security, multiple news outlets reported. `The Joe Biden administration refrained from certain investments in chip sales and data centers in the Middle East over concerns that the technology might be diverted to China, which has growing ties in the region.  `Officials also reportedly worried that Middle East countries could take American jobs. `Pushing back, others like White House AI advisor David Sacks argued that selling AI technologies to the Middle East would help U.S. AI standards spread globally—and would avoid ceding market space to China.  `Trump said today that the UAE would buy some of the most advanced U.S. chips, while Bloomberg reported that new U.S. AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia include language about barring Chinese access.  `Diplomacy in Istanbul. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s no-show at this week’s Ukraine talks slowed diplomatic momentum, but Trump’s sanctions relief for Syria prompted a flurry of new discussions. `Ahead of the lower-level Russia-Ukraine talks today—the first time delegations from the two countries have met since 2022—Trump said that “nothing’s going to happen” until he meets directly with Putin. `U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met his Syrian counterpart yesterday and discussed Syria’s relationship with Israel, concerns over chemical weapons, and the human rights situation in the country. `“There is an AI war and war over data centers happening here in the [Gulf] region. Everybody’s appealing to the big AI players that they can have data centers. Energy is cheap here. Land is abundant. But part of that is that they also want advanced chips to advance their own efforts in AI. I don’t see a lot of resistance to that, to be completely honest with you, as long as the United States gets some sort of assurances with regard to China.”",

      'No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs. `A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament. `The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November – but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides. `On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first. `However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June. `That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date. `The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line. `The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so. `Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved. `It specifically mentions social care workers and pharmacists as among those covered. `During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes. `Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had "lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances". `The MP for Spen Valley added: "Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable." `But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion. `Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying. `"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help," Paul said. `"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I\'m not willing to accept this collateral damage." `At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted. `Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being "distasteful and disrespectful" for accusing the bill\'s opponents of having "undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy" their concerns. `However, Dame Esther\'s daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the "scaremongering", "blatant lies" and "myths" circulating about the bill. `She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was "full of safeguards". `Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a "burden". `Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first. `She told the Commons this "presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives". `But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said "highly trained" medical professionals must be trusted "to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day". `Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink. `However, Leadbeater argued this risk was "negligible". `"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place," she told MPs. `A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death "solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking". `Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable. `Leadbeater\'s Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November. `Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process. `The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides. `Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill. `Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have "deepened" as it has progressed. `He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill "practicable and safe". `If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society. `Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die. `On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.',

      "The bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales will be strengthened and made more workable by proposed changes, Kim Leadbeater, the MP behind the legislation, has said. `As the House of Commons prepared to debate amendments, Leadbeater said fresh protections had been introduced to allow a further check on applications for assisted dying, and ensure doctors and others were able to opt out of involvement in the process. `More than 100 campaigners on both sides of the assisted dying argument gathered outside parliament in a sign of strength of feeling about the issue. `The bill, which passed its second reading by 55 votes, had been due to face another yes-or-no vote on Friday, the committee stage. But the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, granted more time for the debate, meaning the only votes will be on specific amendments. `Despite the lack of an overall vote, the debate will be closely watched for any signs of shifting sentiment among MPs. Opponents of the bill have talked up the idea that a number of supporters have since changed their minds, but only a few MPs have said this publicly. `The Conservative MP George Freeman, who backed the second reading in November, has since said he will vote no, and there are a handful of others understood to be changing their minds. `The TV presenter and campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged all MPs to back Kim Leadbeater’s “strong, safe, carefully considered bill” to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. `In an impassioned letter, the broadcaster, who has stage-four lung cancer, said she and other terminally ill adults asked MPs to allow “a good, pain-free death for ourselves and those we love and care for”. `In Friday’s debate, Jess Asato, a Labour MP, intervened to ask Leadbeater if she would dissociate herself from what she said was Esther Rantzen’s “distasteful and disrespectful” comment about opponents of the bill being motivated by undeclared religious beliefs. Leadbeater said she had not seen the remarks. `During the debate, some MPs raised concerns that the bill could allow applicants to “shop around for doctors” to agree to approve their assisted dying request. `Leadbeater said: “I reject the assertion that patients will shop around, bearing in mind we are talking about dying people: they’re not in a position to start shopping around for services.” `Othes, including the Tory MP Rebecca Paul, objected to the idea that people with anorexia, mental health problems or learning difficulties could under some circumstances become eligible for assisted dying through loopholes in the bill, and urged further safeguards. `A group of MPs from medical backgrounds also implored colleagues to support the bill, saying most healthcare professionals “understand that the current law is not working”. `The MPs’ letter is signed by three former doctors – Neil Shastri-Hurst (Conservative), Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley (both Labour) – and a former nurse, Kevin McKenna (Labour). `They criticised what they called the “misleading” idea that medical professionals tended to oppose assisted dying, saying surveys had shown at worst mixed sentiments. `They wrote: “In our experience, most healthcare professionals understand that the current law is not working. It criminalises compassion and forces dying people into situations no civilised healthcare system should accept: unbearable pain, unmitigated suffering, or the traumatic decision to end their lives overseas. `“As doctors and clinicians, we would not tolerate such a system in any other area of care. As parliamentarians, we cannot defend it now.” `Under the timetable set out by Hoyle, two sets of the amendments agreed in the committee stage will be voted on, first on Friday and then on 13 June. `Leadbeater insisted on Thursday that there had been no major drop in support. “There might be some move in either direction but certainly not a huge amount of movement,” she told LBC radio.",

      "Doctors or care workers will never be compelled to take part in assisted dying if the service is offered in England, MPs have decided as they weigh changes to be introduced to the controversial law. `MPs, who last year narrowly voted to pass a law permitting terminally ill people in England and Wales to seek help ending their own lives, were on Friday debating amendments to the bill. `After an emotionally charged debate in the House of Commons, an amendment was backed stating that “no person is under any duty to participate in the provision of assistance in accordance with this act”. `Critics have warned that safeguards from the bill in order to protect vulnerable people being pressured into ending their lives — such as the requirement for a High Court judge to approve each case — have been watered down. `They have also said that the bill, which as a private members’ bill can only be debated on a Friday, has not received sufficient parliamentary scrutiny given the gravity of its implications. `On Friday Labour MP Naz Shah warned the Commons she would not be “complicit” in approving a “matter of life and death” law without what she believed were adequate safeguards. `“I really, really want to emphasise this to all members listening and the public at home, this process is flawed, fundamentally flawed,” she told MPs. “This is not how we make legislation.” `She also complained that the bill was being rushed through parliament, with just five hours for debate on Friday. `At times the session grew heated, with Jess Asato, another Labour MP and opponent of the bill, accusing Dame Esther Rantzen, the vocal campaigner in favour of reforming the law, of being “distasteful and disrespectful” after she accused opponents of the law change having “undeclared personal religious beliefs”.  `The next round of voting on amendments to the bill will take place on June 13. MPs will then be asked to vote on passing the amended bill in its entirety, which would push it through to the next stage of legislative scrutiny in the House of Lords. `Others spoke passionately in favour of a law change on Friday. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, warned that many had “lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances”. `She added: “If we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.” `Proponents of the bill, which would allow anyone with six months or less to live to seek help to end their own life, had hoped it would take just two years to become available to the public. `However, if passed, it may now take two years longer than expected to come into force because of changes made in recent weeks to the safeguards, even if signed into law this year. `The bill was previously amended to remove the requirement for a High Court judge to sign off on each case. Instead an oversight panel, including a legal figure such as a KC and a psychiatrist, will consider each case. `However, earlier this week the Royal College of Psychiatrists intervened to say it could not support the bill, saying there are “too many unanswered questions about the safeguarding of people with mental illness”. `According to government estimates, more than 4,500 people a year would seek assistance to end their lives if the law comes into force.",
